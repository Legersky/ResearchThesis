This class serves for saving the weight function $q$. The constructor is

\begin{method}{\_\_init\_\_}{B}
Set the input alphabet to \var{B} and the maximum length of window to 1. Initialize the attribute \var{\_mapping} to an empty dictionary for saving the weight function $q$. 
\end{method}

The methods for saving and calling are following:

\begin{method}{addWeightCoefToInput}{\_input, coef}
Save the weight coefficient \var{coef} for \var{\_input} to the class attribute \var{\_mapping}. The digits of \var{\_input} must be in the input alphabet.
\end{method}

\begin{method}{getWeightCoef}{w}
The digits of the list \var{w} are taken from the left until the weight coefficient in the dictionary \var{\_mapping} is found. 
\end{method}

The result of the method \fun{getWeightCoef}{} is used to make this class callable, i.e., if \var{\_q} is an instance of \emph{WeightFunction}, then \var{\_q}.\fun{getWeightCoef}{w} is the same as \var{\_q}(\var{w}).
