Class \emph{WeightCoefficientsSetSearch} implements Phase 1 of the extending window method described in Section \ref{subsec:phase1}. The most important method is  \fun{findWeightCoefficientsSet}{} which returns the weight coefficients set $\Q$.

The constructor of the class is 

\begin{method}{\_\_init\_\_}{ algForParallelAdd, method}
Initialize the ring generator $\omega$, base $\beta$, alphabet $\A$ and input alphabet $\B$ by values obtained from \var{algForParallelAdd}. The parameter \var{method} characterizes the way of the choice from the possible candidates for the weight coefficients set, \var{None} is the default way -- according to absolute values.  
\end{method}

Methods implementing Phase 1 are the following:

\begin{method}{\_findCandidates}{C}
Following Algorithm \ref{alg:searchCand}, return the list of lists \var{candidates} such that each element in \var{C} is covered by any value of the appropriate list in \var{candidates}.  
\end{method}


\begin{method}{\_chooseQk\_FromCandidates}{candidates}
Take the previous intermediate weight coefficients set $\Q_{k}$ as the class attribute and choose from \var{candidates} the intermediate weight coefficients set $\Q_{k+1}$ by Algorithm \ref{alg:extendWeightCoefSet}.
\end{method}


\begin{method}{\_getQk}{C}
Links together methods \fun{\_findCandidates}{C} and \fun{\_chooseQk\_FromCandidates}{} to return itermediate weight coefficients set $\Q_k$.
\end{method}


\begin{method}{findWeightCoefficientsSet}{ maxIterations}
According to Algorithm \ref{alg:weightCoefSet}, return the weight coefficients set $\Q$ which is build iteratively by using \fun{\_getQk}{}. The computation is aborted if the number of iterations exceeds \var{maxIterations}. 
\end{method}
